These scripts are intended to help manage the starting/stopping of
argus client daemons, such as radium and rasplit, both during system boot
as well as in normal operation.  The strategies currently supported are Linux's
chkconfig system, systemctl and Apple Mac OS X's launchctl, using
/Library/StartupItems packages.

With all of these examples, care needs to be taken to ensure that
system configuration files, such as /etc/radium.conf, or /etc/rarc,
are "in sync" with the intent of these daemons, and that the command
line options set the appropriate mode of opertion.

Generally, most system /etc configurations should set the program to
NOT run as a daemon, and the startup scripts should use the "-d" option.
However, this is simply a suggestion.


Under Linux 

The ./radium script takes one of four arguments, start, stop, restart
and status.  If the specific /etc configuration file is not found,
the daemon will be run with some assumptions about the system configuration
and writes its logs to /var/log/radium.

For installation on Linux:

The linux chkconfig system, assumes that the scripts that are run from
the /etc/init.d directory return, as the boot process runs each script
sequentially, and doesn't progress until each process returns.

This means that radium need to run as daemons, in the background.
As a result, do check that the /etc/radium.conf configuration file,
set the [ARGUS|RADIUM}_DAEMON variable to "yes".

Edit the PATH variable in the script to the directory the binary is
located in.

Then, install the script in /etc/rc.d/init.d.  After this, if your system
supports the chkconfig() utility, you can use that to install radium and
then have it start when the system boots.


      # cp radium /etc/rc.d/init.d
      # chkconfig --add radium
      # chkconfig --level 2345 radium on


If your system doesn't have chkconfig(), then simply create a link to the
/etc/rc.d/init.d/radium file in the run level that you want the daemon to
run in.  Most systems will have this as run level 3.
 
      # cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d
      # ln -s ../init.d/radium radium


Systemctl

The radium.service file can be used on Fedora (and RedHat Linux?) to automatically
start radium at boot time.  Put the file radium.service in /lib/systemd/system, then
run these two commands as root:

 # systemctl enable radium.service
 # systemctl start radium.service

After that, radium should be automatically started when the system boots.


Mac OS X

Launchctl

The com.qosient.radium.plist and com.qosient.rasplit.plist configuration files 
are used with the Mac OS X launchctl system.  These files should be installed
into the /Library/LaunchDaemons directory on the target machine.  This will
allow Mac OS X to radium and rasplit  when the machine boots, and to ensure
that they are always running.

The included scripts assume that radium and rasplit have been installed in the
default /usr/local/bin directory, so if you have done something out of the ordinary,
you will need to modify the scripts.

For installation on Mac OS X:
   # cp com.qosient.radium.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
   # cp com.qosient.rasplit.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
   # launchctl load  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.qosient.radium.plist
   # launchctl load  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.qosient.rasplit.plist
