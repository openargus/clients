# You may need to change the ExecStartPre below to manage the
# interface that argus is going to use.  You may also need to
# change the ExecStart line to point to where argus is installed
# on your system, as well as any other arguments to argus.  Note
# that this assumes that you are not using -d or setting
# ARGUS_DAEMON=yes in the config file.

# This was tested on Fedora 16
