# Ralabel Layer 2 IEEE Style Address Configuration File
#
# Carter Bullard
# QoSient, LLC
#
#  This configuration is a ralabel(1) address configuration file.
#
#  This file allows you to specify IEEE 802.3 addresses, 
#  and to provide optional labels that can be associated with
#  those addresses.
#
#  Here is a valid and simple configuration file.   It represents
#  the internal QoSient ethernet address space.
#
#  This style of configuation file is primarily used for LOCAL and
#  non-LOCAL label assignments, using tools like rotop() and
#  general aggregators, that will use the labels as aggregation
#  keys.
