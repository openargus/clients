# Ralabel IANA Style Address Configuration File
#
# Carter Bullard
# QoSient, LLC
#
#  This configuration is a ralabel(1) address configuration file.
#
#  Is to specify CIDR addresses, or ranges of CIDR addresses
#  and to provide labels that can be assigned to those addresses.
#
#  Here is a valid and simple configuration file.   It represents
#  the internal QoSient IPv4 address space.  And the complete Internet
#  address space outside of QoSient.
#
#  Ralabel will insert into an IPv4 patricia tree, labels for the
#  interior and leaf-nodes.  When ralabel() prints the label for a
#  given address, it will be a concatenation of all the labels that
#  apply to that address.  
#
#  Given the configuration below, ralabe() will return these strings
#  for these addresses:
#
#     1.24.4.12       -  "Internet"
#     192.168.0.67    -  "QoSient,Wired,SMTP"
#     192.168.1.17    -  "QoSient,Switzerland"
#     200.24.4.12     -  "Internet"
#     255.255.255.255 -  "Broadcast"  (derived from iana-multicast-address)
