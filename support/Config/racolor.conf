#  RaColor Configuration
#
#  This configuration is a ralabel(1) configuration file, extended to
#  specify color for fields per row..
#
#  Flow Filter Based Classification
#    Flow filter based classification uses the standard flow
#    filter strategies to provide a general purpose labeling scheme.
#    The concept is similar to racluster()'s fall through matching
#    scheme.  Fall through the list of filters, if it matches, paint the
#    field with the specified color.  If you want to continue through
#    the list, once there is a match,  add a "cont" to the end of
#    the matching rule.  This will paint other fields with additional
#    color specifications.
#
#    The format is:
#       filter="ra filter"  color="field[,field,...]:COLOR"  [cont]
#
#       filter can be any working ra flow record filter
#       col can be any working ra flow record filter
#
