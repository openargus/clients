************************************************************

IMPORTANT:

Send bug (error) reports, questions and comments to the mailing
list at argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu.

Please use the './bin/argusclientbug' script when posting bug reports
about Argus clients. Argusclientbug will gather some information about your
system and start your editor with a form in which you can describe
your problem.  Delete information that you consider non-relevant
to your problem.  Bug reports not generated by Argusbug might
be silently ignored by the Argus maintainers, so please use the
tool.  A report that says 'Argus does not work. Why?' will
not be considered a valid bug report.
