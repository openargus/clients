# Example rapolicy.conf
#
# Rapolicy, like most ra* programs, can read a program specific
# configuration file.   This is an example configuration for rapolicy()
# that provides the opportunity to modify the default behavior of
# parsing a Cisco ACL definition, and reporting on flows that match
# aspects of the policy defined by the ACL.
# 
# This file is read by rapolicy() from the command line using the
# " -f rapolicy.conf " option.
#
# RA_POLICY_DUMP_POLICY is a debugging aid. If it is set to yes, then rapolicy() will read
# and parse the ACL file and output an English language description of the actions associated
# with each ACL entry. After outputting the explaination, rapolicy will exit.

#RA_POLICY_DUMP_POLICY="yes"

# The rapolicy client parses a Cisco IOS ACL and constructs a filter which is used
# to permit or deny flows. Under normal circumstances the packets meeting the 
# criteria for a permit rule are output by the client. There are circumstances where
# it is useful to see the flows that are dropped. RA_POLICY_SHOW_WHICH can be set
# to a value of "deny" in these cases.

#RA_POLICY_SHOW_WHICH="permit"

# Under normal operating conditions, only the flow records that match a permit
# or a deny rule (depending on the value of RA_POLICY_SHOW_WHICH) are output. In
# some instance like baselining the actions of an ACL, the goal is to have a fully
# labeled set of flows regardless of the ACL's permit or deny determination. In these
# instances, a value of yes for RA_POLICY_JUST_LABEL will allow the full processing of
# the flows and will label them according to the settings of the label flags but all of
# the flows handled by the ACL will be output

RA_POLICY_JUST_LABEL="no"


# A Cisco IP ACL normally has no impact on non-IP traffic eg: ARP, DDCMP, Slotted-Aloha
# RA_POLICY_PERMIT_OTHERS can be set to "yes" for the normal behavior or "no" to block
# non-IP traffic

#RA_POLICY_PERMIT_OTHERS="yes"


# The rapolicy client can add a label to a flow indicating the action (permit, deny,
# or implictDeny), the ACL name or number) and the line within the ACL that caused the
# action. 
#
# if RA_POLICY_LABEL_LOG is set to "yes" labels will be added to flows matching ACL 
# entries that have a log qualifier.

RA_POLICY_LABEL_LOG="no"


# If RA_POLICY_LABEL_ALL is set to "yes" regardless of the value of RA_POLICY_LABEL_LOG,
# any flow that matches an ACL entry will be labeled

RA_POLICY_LABEL_ALL="no"


# Every Cisos IOS ACL has an implicit deny as its last entry. Flows that do not match any
# ACL entry are usually dropped silently. RA_POLICY_LABEL_IMPLICIT will label flows that
# are dropped by the implicit deny rule. Under normal circumstances, these flows are not
# labeled. The values of RA_POLICY_LABEL_ALL and RA_POLICY_LABEL_LOG do not govern the 
# labeling of these flows.

RA_POLICY_LABEL_IMPLICIT="no"


# The ACL is contained in a standard ASCII text file which is identified by the value of
# RA_POLICY_ACL_FILE Since rapolicy is not designed to be a syntax checker, it is a 
# good idea to create the ACL on a Cisco device and take the output of show running
# (or the appropriate equivalent command) as the input ACL for rapolicy()
# The policy file should be defined as the last item in the rapolicy.conf file
# or there may be unexpected side effects

#RA_POLICY_ACL_FILE="/tmp/ACL03.txt"
