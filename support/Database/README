These scripts are intended to manage various aspects of using MySQL
with Argus data.  While the list is short now, we hope that it will
grow quickly.

MySQL.Archive.sh - This program moves argus data from a standard MySQL
    archive to a standard native file system archive, and indexes for
    time. Standard implies that the database table and the native file
    system repository have the datetime as a part of its name.

    This program is intended to provide repository migration for formal
    data rention policies.  The notion is that you'll have data in the
    database for some period of time, and then you will want to move the
    primitive data, so that its available, but not within the RDMBS.

    The database repository should have been created using rasqlinsert(),
    and have the 'record' attribute in its schema definition.  This is
    the actual argus record that will be inserted into the native file
    system archive.  rasql() will read the data from the data base,
    and pipe its output to rasplit() which will populate the native
    file system archive.

    You will need to set these variables to your liking:
       MYSQL_USER="the mysql account that has permissions on the table"
       MYSQL_HOST="the host where mysql runs"
       MYSQL_DATABASE="the mysql database name"
       MYSQL_TABLE="the table name, the script will add the data string to the end"

       ARCHIVE_FILESYSTEM="/Path/To/The/Argus/Archive"

If you have any issues, send email to the list.
