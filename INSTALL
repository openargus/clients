QUICK MAKE

If you are reading this file, all is ready, and you should be able
to make argus-clients by simply typing:

   % ./configure
   % make

If you have any problems with this procedure, read further, if not
congratulations.  You can proceed to INSTALLATION.


DEPENDENCIES

The Argus client package is dependant on two public domain packages
flex and bison(), to generate the flow filter compilers.  Both of
these packages are in most Linux, MacOS X, BSD and Cygwin distributions,
but must be installed in order to compile argus-clients.

The official site for flex is:
http://www.gnu.org/software/flex

The official site for bison is:
http://www.gnu.org/software/bison

Please refer to the individual packages for installation instructions.

Some argus-clients use curses to maintain screen formating, such
as ratop() and rasqlinsert().  For these programs, you should have a
curses development package installed, such as "ncurses-devel". 
Ratop would like to use the readline library, if available.  While not
required, readline is recommended.

For some OS's, such as Mac OS X, which does not ship with readline, due to
licensing issues, installing these packages is optional.

Some argi are configured to use strong authentication and encryption 
when transporting it data over the wire.  Argus clients can be compiled
to support this strong authentication strategy by compiling with ARGUS_SASL
support and linking to the cryptographic package SASL, the Simple Authentication
and Security Layer.  Because of its features and flexibility, we highly
recommend using SASL, and becoming experienced with its administration.

CONFIGURE

The program, ./configure, will scan the file system, looking for
the various programs, routines and libraries needed to compile
the argus clients.  There are a large number of options that can
be used when compiling the argus client programs.  Run:

   ./configure --help

to see what options are available.


BUILDING ARGUS-CLIENTS
So, after all that, to build Argus on a supported platform, first run
./configure.  ./configure will determine your system attributes and
generate subdirectories and the appropriate Makefiles from the Makefile.in
files found in the distribution.  After running ./configure, run "make".
If everything goes well, appropriate libraries and binaries will be found
in the ./bin and ./lib subdirectories.  So, ....

   % ./configure
   % make

The argus clients will be found in the ./bin directory, all starting with "ra".


So, at this point you should have all the execuables needed.  But,
if you are having problems, it may be related to your compiler, or
the flex and bison utilities, the availability of sasl or readline,
or other libraries that argus-clients needs.  So, ...

You will need an ANSI C compiler to build argus.  If your compiler
is not ANSI compliant, we highly recommend using the GNU C compiler,
available via anonymous ftp:

	ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gcc-*.tar.gz


As mentioned above, argus clients require bison and flex.  For
flex, version 2.4.6 or higher is recommended.  The current version
of flex and bison are available via anonymous ftp:

        ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/bison-*.tar.gz
        ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/non-gnu/flex/flex-*.tar.gz

Now, if you are still having problems, ..., well its hard to say
from here what it might be.  So, you may want to send us some email.


ISSUES INVOLVING PERL

There are a number of perl scripts in the argus-clients distribution,
and if you are like many sites, you may have multiple versions of perl
on your system.  We do not current provide a self configuring perl package
for all the perl scripts, instead, we use ./configure to configure the
perl scripts to find the path to the correct version of perl.

If you want to specify a path for perl other than the discovered standard
path for perl, use the "--with-perl dir" option to ./configure.  I use this
option on my Snow Leopard machine, as I've installed the perl from MacPorts
onto my system.

   % ./configure --with-perl=/opt/local/bin



INSTALLATION

QUICK INSTALL

If all things are well at this point, and you will be using
the installation strategy that we provide, all you need to do
 now is:

   # make install

If you are unsure about the standard installtion, run

   % make -n install

to review what make will try to do.  If you would like to
do something other than the standard install, then please
continue to read through this file.


YOUR OWN INSTALL

Argus-clients do not have any installation retrictions, so you
can install them anywhere.  There are some conventions that have
been established, and I'll present them here, but you can, of
course, do your own thing.

By default, argus-clients installation involves installing:
   1.  the argus-client ra* executables into /usr/local/bin
   2.  radium() into /usr/local/sbin
   3.  argus-client include files into /usr/local/include/argus
   4.  documentation into /usr/local/share/[man | doc]
   5.  pkgconfig configuruation, argus-clients.pc, into /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
   6.  support files into /usr/local/argus

All of these destinations share "/usr/local" which is the default ARGUSHOME.
Changing this strategy is accomplished through the ./configure program.

The ./configure program provides a large number of options for
configuring your package.  Type "./configure --help" to see all
the options that are available.

I have found it useful in the past to have an argus home directory
to hold the binaries, client configuration files, and hold my argus
data archive.  With time, of course, things change, and the need for
these functions to be in a common directory is no longer important.
However, consolidating argus into a common directory structure is a
good thing for many.  


This is easily done setting the ./configure $prefix variable at run time.

   % ./configure --prefix=/usr/argus
   % make install

This will result in creation of the /usr/argus directory, containing 
populated ./argus, ./bin, ./include, ./lib, ./sbin and ./share directories.

I have used /usr/argus, /opt/argus, /opt/local/argus with varying
degrees of success, depending on the OS.  If you have any problems, do
send email to the developers mailing list, or send a bug report.


Argus-clients have a rc style configuration strategy, to set things
like the output date format, what columns to print out etc .. 
You can have a system wide configuration file that would reside
as /etc/ra.conf.  Clients will look here by default for its base
configuration, and then look for a .rarc file in your home directory.
So you don't have to have a system wide configuration file, unless
you prefer it.

   # cp ./support/Config/ra.conf /etc/ra.conf

You will want to edit this file to choose values of your
liking.  The sample has all the common values set and is
a good suggestion.  Please refer to the sample to make your
personal changes.


This should handle the basic installion.

Any comments, patches, bug reports or additions should be sent to 
argus@qosient.com.



PORTABILITY

Argus-clients have been developed on Sparc architectures under SunOS 4.1.x
and Solaris 2.7, and have been successfully ported to Solaris, SGI, Ultrix,
Linux, OpenBSD and FreeBSD platforms, as well as Cygwin.
 
No claim is made as to the portability of argus-clients to other platforms,
although it is much easier now that we've addressed the big endian little
endian issues.  If you make any modifications to support installing and
running argus-clients in any other environment, please send us comments
and/or patches.  We will be most grateful.
