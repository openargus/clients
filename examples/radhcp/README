This directory contains source code for radhcp.1, an example program that
uses the user data found in DHCP argus records to track if the addresses
in the flows were learned from DHCP.

The basic idea is that argus has parsed all the traditional network
headers, TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc ... and the DHCP payload data that argus 
captures is a binary copy of the complete data in the packet found 
after these headers.  Using parsing engines, such as tcpdump or wireshark's,
the DHCP requests and responses are check for protocol conformity, and
then categorized by DHCP content.

The addresses which were advertised as authoratative answers, are
tracked and all flow records received has their addresses checked to see
if they were learned through DHCP.

Because flows can live much longer than the DHCP references to the addresses
being used, you only really want to check the START records to see if there
is a DHCP cache at the time of the start of transaction.

In gargoyle's end system approach for Linux/Mac OS X, we also have argus
events to tell us if there are long lived flows to expect, which we can
use to notify the DHCP tracking engine that some of the flows addresses
need not be searched.

Because gargoyles argus may not capture the complete packet payload, the
routines do ensure that they deal with truncation well.  

Radhcp.1 is an example, and as such, you should be able to add your own
decoders, pretty quickly.  


See the manpage for radhcp.1 for details.
