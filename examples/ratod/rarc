# Ra* clients will open this file if its in the users HOME directory,
# or in the $ARGUSHOME directory, and parse it to set common configuration
# options.  All of these values will be overriden by those options
# set on the command line, or in the file specified using the -f option.
#
# Values can be quoted to make string denotation easier, however, the
# parser does not require that string values be quoted.  To support this,
# the parse will remove '\"' characters from input strings, so do not
# use this character in strings themselves.
#
# Values specified as "" will be treated as a NULL string, and the parser
# will ignore the variable setting.

#
# All ra* clients can attach to a remote server, and collect argus data
# in real time.  This variable can be a name or a dot notation IP address.
#
#RA_ARGUS_SERVER=localhost:561

#
# You can specify the source port that will be used on all remote TCP
# connections, using this variable.
#
#RA_SOURCE_PORT=13564


# Any ra* program can generate a pid file, which can be
# used to control the number of instances that the system
# can support.  However, creating a system pid file may
# require priviledges that are inappropriate for all cases.
#
# When configured to generate a pid file, if a file called
# ra*.pid (where ra* is the name of the program in question)
# exists in the RA_PID_PATH directory, and a program
# exists with a pid that matches the one contained in the
# file, then the program will not start.  If the pid does
# not exist, then the ra* program replaces the value in the
# file, with its own pid.   If a pid file does not exist,
# then the ra* program will create it in the RA_PID_PATH
# directory, if it can.  The end result is that the system
# will support only one instanace of the program, based
# on name, running at a time.
#
# The default value is to not generate a pid.  The default
# path for the pid file, is /var/run.
#
# No Commandline equivalent
#
#
RA_SET_PID="no"
RA_PID_PATH="/var/run"


# Argus supports the use of SASL to provide strong
# authentication and confidentiality protection.
#
# When argus is compiled with SASL support, ra* clients may be
# required to authenticate to the argus server before the argus
# will accept the connection.  This variable will allow one to
# set the user and authorization id's, if needed.  Although
# not recommended you can provide a password through the
# RA_AUTH_PASS variable.  The format for this variable is:
#
# RA_USER_AUTH="user_id/authorization_id"
#
#RA_USER_AUTH="user/user"
#RA_AUTH_PASS="password"

# The clients can specify a part of the negotiation of the
# security policy that argus uses. This is controlled through
# the use of a minimum and maximum allowable protection
# strength values.  Set these variable to control this policy.
#
 
#RA_MIN_SSF=0
#RA_MAX_SSF=128


# All ra* clients can support writing its output as Argus Records into
# a file.  Stdout can be specified using "-".  The format is:
#    "output.file filter"
#
#RA_OUTPUT_FILE="/tmp/ra.out tcp"


# All ra* clients can support filtering its input based on a time
# range. The format is:
#      timeSpecification[-timeSpecification]
#
# where the format of a timeSpecification can be one of these:
#      [mm/dd[/yy].]hh[:mm[:ss]]
#      mm/dd[/yy]
#
#RA_TIMERANGE=""


# All ra* clients can support running for a number of seconds,
# while attached to a remote source of argus data.  This is a type
# of polling.  The default is zero (0), which means run indefinately.
#
RA_RUN_TIME=0


# Specify if ra* clients should print management records by default.  
# This does not affect management record processing, nor down stream
# management record propagation.
#
RA_PRINT_MAN_RECORDS=yes
RA_PRINT_EVENT_RECORDS=yes


# Most ra* clients are designed to print argus records out in ASCII,
# with each client supporting its own output formats.  For ra() like
# clients, this variable will generate column headers as labels.
# The number is the number of lines between repeated header output.
# Setting this value to zero (0) will cause the labels to be printed
# once.  If you don't want labels,  then comment this line out or
# delete it.
#
RA_PRINT_LABELS=0


# All ra* clients are designed to provide flexibility in what data
# is printed when configured to generate ASCII output.
# For ra() like clients, this variable overide the default field
# printing specification.  This is the equivalent to the "-s option".
# The below example is the default field definition.
#
RA_FIELD_SPECIFIER="stime flgs proto saddr sport dir daddr dport spkts dpkts sbytes dbytes state"


# Most ra* clients are designed to print argus records out in ASCII,
# with each client supporting its own output formats.  For ra() like
# clients, this variable can overide the default field delimiter,
# which are variable spans of space (' '), to be any character.
# The most common are expected to be '\t' for tabs, and ',' for
# comma separated fields.
#
RA_FIELD_DELIMITER=''


# The field width generates columnar output for the ra* programs,
# but in some cases, you don't really want a lot of white space
# in your output.
# 
# To handle these cases, use the RA_FIELD_WIDTH variable to specify
# whether you want 'variable' or 'fixed'.  'fixed' is the default.
# 
# When using 'variable', the field width is the length of the string
# needed to print the entire field's value.  This is generally the
# ideal behavior when you want to use the output in other programs,
# such as the use of CSV ('comma seperated values') formated input
# for importing into Excel.
# 
# When the field delimiter is changed, all ra* programs will change
# to 'variable' field widths.  To override this, remove the comment
# below, so that you explicitly set the width to be 'fixed'.
# 
#RA_FIELD_WIDTH='fixed'


# For ra() like clients, this variable will control the
# translation of numbers to names, such as resolving hostnames, 
# and print port or protocol names.  There can be a huge performance
# impact with name lookup, so the default is to not resolve hostnames.
#
# Valid options are 'none' to print no names, 'proto'
# translate the protocol names, 'port' to translate 
# port names, and 'all' to translate all fields.  An
# invalid value will default to 'port', silently.
#
RA_PRINT_NAMES=port


# Ra() clients when printing numeric IP addresses, print them
# as CIDR addresses.  CIDR notation is constructed from the IP address and
# the prefix size, the latter being the number of leading 1 bits of the
# routing prefix. The IP address is expressed according to the standards
# of IPv4 or IPv6. It is followed by a separator character, the forward
# slash (/) character, and the prefix size expressed as a decimal number.
#
# Argus IPv4 data contains the CIDR mask length, when its less than 32,
# and ra* programs will by default provides the "/masklen" suffix when
# the mask is less than 32.
#
# This maybe confusing for some data processors, which would rather see
# the "/masklen" never, or all the time.  Use this option to specify
# changes in the default printing stratgy.
#
# Accepatable values for this variable are:
#     "no"     -  do not provide the CIDR mask length (legacy mode) [default]
#     "yes"    -  print CIDR mask length when less than 32
#     "strict" -  always print CIDR mask length
#
RA_CIDR_ADDRESS_FORMAT="yes"


# For ra() like clients, this variable will include the response
# data that is provided by Argus.  This is protocol and state
# specific.
#
RA_PRINT_RESPONSE_DATA=no
 

# For ra() like clients, this variable will force the timestamp
# to be in Unix time format, which is an integer representing the
# number of elapsed seconds since the epoch.
#
RA_PRINT_UNIX_TIME=no


# For ra() like clients, the format that is used to print
# timestamps, is based on the strftime() library call, with
# an extension to print fractions of a sec "%f".  The
# default is "%T.%f".  You can overide this default time
# format by setting this variable.  This string must conform
# to the format specified in strftime().  Malformed strings can
# generate interesting output, so be aware with this one, and
# don't forget the '.' when doing fractions of a second.
#
RA_TIME_FORMAT="%Y/%m/%d.%T.%f"


# The timezone used for timestamps is specified by the
# tzset() library routines, and is normally specified by
# factors such as the TZ environment variable found on
# most machines.  You can override the TZ environment variable
# by specifying a time zone using this variable.  The format
# of this string must conform to the format specified by
# tzset(3).
#
#RA_TZ="EST5EDT4,M3.2.0/02,M11.1.0/02"


# For ra() like clients, this variable is used to override the
# time format of the timestamp.  This variable specifies the
# number of decimal places that will be printed as the fractional
# part of the time.  Argus collects usec precision, and so a
# maximum value of 6 is supported.  To not print the fractional
# part, specify the value zero (0).
#
RA_USEC_PRECISION=6


# Argus can capture user data.  When printing out the user data
# contents, using tools such as raxml(), the type of encoding
# can be specified here. Supported values are "Ascii", "Encode64",
# or "Encode32".
#
#RA_USERDATA_ENCODE=Encode32
#RA_USERDATA_ENCODE=Encode64
#RA_USERDATA_ENCODE=Ascii

# If compiled to support this option, ra* clients are capable
# of generating a lot of use [full | less | whatever] debug
# information.  The default value is zero (0).
#
#RA_DEBUG_LEVEL=0

# Ra style clients use a non-blocking method to connect to
# remote data sources, so the user can control how long to
# wait if a remote source doesn't respond.  This variable sets
# the number of seconds to wait.  This number should be set to
# a reasonable value (5 < value < 60).  The default value is
# 10 seconds.
#
#RA_CONNECT_TIME=10


# You can provide a filter expression here, if you like.
# It should be limited to 2K in length.  The default is to
# not filter.
#
#RA_FILTER=""


# Many ra* programs sort records as a part of their function.
# Programs like rasort.1, providing explicit command-line options
# to specify the sort algorithms and their order, using the
# '-m field [field ...]' option.
#
# Use this configuration directive to specify the default sorting
# algorithm table for your ra* programs.  The default sort algorithm
# is record start time "stime".
#
#RA_SORT_ALGORITHMS="stime "



# Some ra* clients have a timeout based function.  Ratop, as an
# example, times out flows and removes them from  screen at a fixed
# interval.  This variable can be set using the RA_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL
# variable, which is a float in seconds. 60.0 seconds is the default.
#
#RA_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL=60.0


# Some ra* clients have an interval based function.  Ratop, as an
# example, can refresh the screen at a fixed interval.  This variable
# can be set using the RA_UPDATE_INTERVAL variable, which is a
# float in seconds.  0.5 seconds is the default.
#
#RA_UPDATE_INTERVAL=0.5


# All ra* clients have the ability to print country codes for the
# IP addresses that are in a flow record.  Country codes are 
# generated from the ARIN delegated address space files.  Specify
# the location of your DELEGATED_IP file here.
#
# No Commandline equivalent
#
RA_DELEGATED_IP="/usr/local/argus/delegated-ipv4-latest"


# All ra* clients can reliably connect to remote data sources.
# This causes the ra* program to try to reconnect to lost remote
# sources every 5 seconds, indefinately. This causes ra* program
# to not terminate but retry connection attempts when they fail.
#
# This feature is implemented using threads, and so threads
# support must be compiled in.
#
# No Commandline equivalent
#
#RA_RELIABLE_CONNECT=no


# Many ra* clients can connect and use a MySQL database, either
# reading for writing.  This may require references to remotes
# database hosts, databases, tables, and mysql account names
# and passwords.
#
# Default values for these variables can be set here.
# support must be compiled in.
#
# Commandline equivalents:
#   -r mysql://[username[:password]@]hostname[:port]/database/tablename
#   -w mysql://[username[:password]@]hostname[:port]/database/tablename
