Final tweaks for pcre library.  On Mac OS X, searching was broken,
and the fix was to move the -L /opt/local/lib -l pcreposix -l pcre
to the front of the link.  Not a good solution on Mac OS X.
Still needs testing on linux and X.

This version does have argus event correlation, but have to
turn it on.

Support for flow based coloring is done.  Seems to work fine.
Entry in rarc file, and a reference to this racolor.conf
file, which is in the ./support/Config directory.

Work on color.
Need support for coloring lines based on country codes, IP addresses etc...

Added .rarc support to turn color on/off
Fixed ':n' option.  No longer toggling, need to set the type you want.
Fixed ':P' option to pause the screen.

Set color map for IP addresss.  BLUE is 'me', CYAN is 'my net',
grey's are for multicast.  Search terms are VIOLET.

In order to serve all the basic functions, mpc (multiprobe
correlation), tsc (trans semantic correlation), we need to
have individual parser contexts per " srcid ".

We've now got an ArgusDomainQueue that holds per observation
domain structures, that currently has only the srcid and
an ArgusWindowStruct.  In the first pass implementation, we
have one domain, without a srcid, that holds the pre allocated
RaDataWindowStruct as its window, which references the default
RaDisplayWindow, as its window.  This is for testing purposes.  

The RaDisplayWindow is the " current " window, and the idea is
if you want to change observation domain focus, you will use 
the new domain to assign a new RaDisplayWindow.

All windows are in the ArgusWindowQueue, but are pointed to by
the ArgusDomainStructs, which provide some form of ownership.
There doesn't have to be a unique window per domain, but some
domains may want to have compound windows, so we'll need to
swap out that when we flip.

We only update the RaDisplayWindow, and there must be a data
source associated with the domain.  Because a single ArgusInput
can provide data from multiple sources, and when an input goes
away, we need to deal with all the sources, we'll want to
put the ArgusDomainStruct maintenance, in the ArgusInput struct
routines.

That is the next step, assign data sources to ArgusDomainStructs.

Some work done to revive "-M rate bin:size" option to do a windowed
view into data.  Lots of bugs fixed, but incomplete implementation
at this time.

Current racurses() is a full function ratop with raevents integration
The next steps are to integrate rasqlinsert -r functionality, so we
can read from database tables, and of course the final step is rampc().
