Argus-5.0 Clients Ratop Readme

Ratop() is a complex program that is trying to be the program of choice
for browsing argus data.  While it started as a 'top' program for flows,
it is evolving to becoming a flow browser, opening files, remote sockets,
searching and editing flow data.

Ratop() is moving in the direction of becoming vi.1 for argus flow data. 
While vi.1 is not the program of choice for all people, ratop() is just an
example program, so don't be too harse about the decision to look like vi.

Ratop() is a curses program that uses readline() to provide input string
editing and formating. Without a modern ncurses and readline library,
ratop() doesn't do as good of a job as it can.


Mac OS X
Snow Leopard is an excellent OS, but ...., the distribution doesn't provide
a completely functional readine library.

Use the MacPorts implementation of readline, and things work fine on Snow Leopard.
After installing the MacPorts distribution, as root, I run this command:

   # port install readline

The argus-clients distribution configure script knows how to find libraries
that have been installed in /opt/local whatever.
