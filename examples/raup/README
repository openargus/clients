 *  raup - Ra based acceptable use policy client problem.
 *         This program grabs its configuration from the database,
 *         getting its set of acceptable use policies that need to
 *         be evaluated.  These PolicySets will specify a list of
 *         policies, a serviceDesc such as dns, ntp, ldap, a
 *         client list, a server list, which can be referenced,
 *         managed, labeled as 'groups', the action related to
 *         the policy and a time for when the policy is in action.
 *
 *         This is designed to provide service based policy verification,
 *         which maybe in the form of an access control policy,
 *         an acceptable use policy, or as a mitigation verification
 *         statement.
