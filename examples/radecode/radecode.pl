# Since ~.rarc may modify the default settings, I use -X to reset everything to a known value before I use -n which cycles
# through the options based on the number of 'n's that it has seen and can lead to very strange results in some instances
# The other ra parameters that I use:
# -n do not translate port numbers to service names
# -u use UNIX time (seconds since the epoc)
# -p 6 use 6 digits of precision after the decimal point in the timestamp and anywhere else that it applies
# -M printer='hex' output the user data in the format that I need for this program
# -L -1 do not output any column headers
# -s proto sport dport stime saddr daddr smac dmac sttl stcpb suser:2000 output the following fields:
#    protocol as a protocol name (tcp, udp, icmp ...)
#    source port number
#    destination port number
#    start time for the flow record as a UNIX time and date stamp with six digits after the decimal point
#    source address
#    destination address
#    source MAC address
#    destination MAC address
#    source time to live
#    source base sequence number (only for TCP flows)
#    Source user data (a maximum of 2000 bytes which may inlcude full or partial data from one or more of the packets that make
#           up the flow all depending on the configuration of the capturing Argus (Argii) text2pcap and tshark deal with the
#           variations of user data with a pretty impressive amount of grace, the people attempting to read the output, not so much.
