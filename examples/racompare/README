Gargoyle Clients 5.0 Racompare Readme
QoSient, LLC

Racompare.1 is a complex program that is designed to compare two argus data
sets, and report on the differences.

Racompare.1 is based on ratop.1, so that you can see the outcome of the comparisons
on a terminal screen.  As such, racompare() is a curses program that uses readline()
to provide input string editing and formating. Without a modern ncurses and readline
library, racompare() doesn't do as good of a job as it can.

There will be two files fed to racompare.1, the baseline, and then the data to
compare to the baseline.  There are 3 basic outputs
   1. datasets where the baseline has an entry, but the input file does not.
   2. datasets where the baseline and input have matches, but they are different
   3. datasets where the baseline does not have a matching entry.

The model used for matches is specified on the command-line as a key function (-m).

In curses, colors can be used to indicate matches and misses.

Mac OS X
Since Snow Leopard, Mac OS X is an excellent OS, but ...., the distribution doesn't provide
a completely functional readine library.

Use the MacPorts implementation of readline, and things work fine on Snow Leopard.
After installing the MacPorts distribution, as root, I run this command:

   # port install readline

The argus-clients distribution configure script knows how to find libraries
that have been installed in /opt/local whatever.
