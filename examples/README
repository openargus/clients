This directory contains source code for example programs that 
demonstrate additional reading, parsing and processing of Argus
data.  The types of functions that these examples provide include:

   argus data environment
      ratop - realtime argus data processing environment (curses based)
         provides vi() like functionality for streaming and file based flow data,
         supporting printing, searching, editing, sorting, writing argus data.

   argus data processing
      raconvert - ascii to binary data record conversion
      raevent - non flow data printing
      rafilteraddr - high performance filtering
      ralabel - semantic enhancement / metadata tagging
      rastream - stream block processing
      rastrip - data compression

   analytics
      rahisto - frequency distribution analysis for argus data metrics

   graphing
      ragraph - time series graphing (rrd-tool based)
      raplot - general plotting (gnuplot based)

   storage management
      ramysql - mysql based utilities
        rasql          - read native argus data from mysql database tables.
        rasqlinsert    - insert and read argus data from/to mysql data tables.
        rasqltimeindex - generate argus data file time indexes for searching.

   forensics
      radump      - decode captured user data
      ragrep      - regular expression matching from captured user data
      raservices  - user data analysis to determine used protocol
      radecode    - use tshark to decode captured user data

   reporting
      radark      - scanner detection and reporting
      rahosts     - IP address inventory reporting
      raips       - IP address inventory reporting
      rapath      - print topology information derived from argus data
      rapolicy    - continuous access control policy verification
      raports     - application port usage
      rarpwatch   - arpwatch driven using argus data
      ratimerange - argus data file time span

   development
      ratemplate  - ra client development template when using the argus clients library.

Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code
contributions, etc., should be sent to the Argus mailing list
email address, "argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu".

************************************************************

IMPORTANT:

Send bug (error) reports, questions and comments to the mailing
list at argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu.

Please use the './bin/argusclientbug' script when posting bug reports
about Argus clients. Argusclientbug will gather some information about your
system and start your editor with a form in which you can describe
your problem.  Delete information that you consider non-relevant
to your problem.  Bug reports not generated by Argusbug might
be silently ignored by the Argus maintainers, so please use the
tool.  A report that says 'Argus does not work. Why?' will
not be considered a valid bug report.
