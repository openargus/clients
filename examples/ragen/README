Ragen.1 is designed to generate a stream of argus flow records based on a
baseline defintion of flow records.  The concept is to use each flow record
in the baseline as a template for generating flow records.  The basis for this
is rabins.1 which will take a flow record and "split" it into time ranges ...

This technique is used to generate the expected records, 

All of this is structured in a radium.1 framework, so that it can read live
data, if it needs it, and offer generated live streams from sockets.

Ragen.1 also introduces a new protocol, similar to the argus protocol, where
the client needs to identify what baseline it is interested in, at what interval
and for how long.  Eventually, the protocol will allow the client to specify a
method for generating the flows.
