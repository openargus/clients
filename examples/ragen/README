Clients request a generated flow, using the -M gen=" ... " where the string assigned
to gen is the basic generator configuration.  Currently the configuration syntax is:

   baseline=uuid;startime=time;interval=float;dur=float

      uuid:     this is an id for the baseline definition ...
                for convenience we provide support for files, and database lookups ...

      time:     any valid argus time specification
      interval: float of status record generationg in seconds
      dur:      float of duration in seconds

Ragen.1 is designed to generate a stream of argus flow records based on a
baseline defintion of flow records.  The concept is to use each flow record
in the baseline as a template for generating flow records.  The basis for this
is rabins.1 which will take a flow record and "split" it into time ranges ...

This technique is used to generate the expected records, 

All of this is structured in a radium.1 framework, so that it can read live
data, if it needs it, and offer generated live streams from sockets.

Ragen.1 also introduces a new protocol, similar to the argus protocol, where
the client needs to identify what baseline it is interested in, at what interval
and for how long.  Eventually, the protocol will allow the client to specify a
method for generating the flows.
