Currently in performance trials with the latest incarnation.
This program is being used as the foundation for most of the
situational awareness backing stores.  The trial is establishing
a series of database tables that are being updated continuously.

   raisql -nnd -S apophis -M rmon -P ratop:etherHost -m srcid smac saddr \
      -s stime dur srcid smac saddr pkts bytes -U root - ip

   raisql -nnd -S apophis -P ratop:etherMatrix -m srcid macmatrix \
      -s stime dur srcid smac dmac pkts bytes -U root


These two databases provide most of the base information for understanding
probes observation domain, what L2 identities are being observed, and
the L3 addresses that are behind those L2 identities.

raisql is turning into a very interesting program.
when using -S 'host', it will load up a mysql table with
data using the RADIUM_SQL_FIELDS to specify the database key.
 
   raisql -f raisql.conf -S host -P projectName -n - tcp or udp
 
Currently the -n and the 'tcp or udp' filter are important
as icmp traffic does not generate a good SQL key, and it
tries to insert icmp entries when it collides with an existing
one, creating a "DUPLICATE ..." error in mysql().
 
The ratop style cache is maintained in the database, and
the update rate, is controlled by the update timers, ala
ratop().
