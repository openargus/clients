NOTES
  The concept is to provide a number of labeling strategies
  with configuration capabilities for each of the labelers.
  This allows the user to specify the order of the labeling,
  which is provided to support hierarchical labeling.

  The basic label strategies that are supported are:

     RALABEL_IEEE_ADDRESS
     RALABEL_IANA_ADDRESS
     RALABEL_ARIN_COUNTRY_CODES
     RALABEL_BIND_NAME
     RALABEL_IANA_PORT
     RALABEL_ARGUS_FLOW
     RALABEL_LOCALITY
     RALABEL_GEOIP_ASN

A Sample conf file is in ./support/Config/ralabel.conf
and describes specifics about each strategy ...
