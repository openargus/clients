rascanner.pl is an example of a straight forward  AIS database processor using perl.
rascanner uses the hostsInventory table for a given day to generate a list of addresses,
both local and remote that have touched a "thresh"old of addresses during the day.
From that list, rascanner uses the locality descriptions to label the ipMatrix
table addresses that match the hostsInventory list as local or remote, and uses
this information to report on the number of class C subnets that have been touched,
along with the number of hosts touched within that subnet.

rascanner.pl suports a number of options, but most importantly it offers:
   -local       reports on scanning originating and terminating in the local network.
   -remote      reports on scanning originating and terminating remotely.
   -outsidein   reports on scanning originating remotely and terminating locally.
   -insideout   reports on scanning originating locally and terminating remotely.
