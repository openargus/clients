Added radnsdb.pl as a helper application for using radns data from mysql.
Radnsdb is passed a date, and it reads dns transactions from the appropriate
dnsFlows/dns_%Y_%m_%d table, and writes json strings into a dnsNames database.

This dnsNames database, can be used by the dnsq.pl to find json data for specific
IP addresses for any given date.


Used this to populate the dnsNames database from an existing dnsFlows database.

for i in `mysql -u root dnsFlows --skip-column-names -Be "show tables"`; do echo $i; radnsdb -t `echo $i | awk 'BEGIN{FS="_"}{print $2"/"$3"/"$4}'` -w mysql://root@localhost/dnsNames/$i; done


This directory contains source code for radns.1, an example program that
uses the user data found in DNS argus records to track if the addresses
in the flows were learned from DNS.

The basic idea is that argus has parsed all the traditional network
headers, TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc ... and the DNS payload data that argus 
captures is a binary copy of the complete data in the packet found 
after these headers.  Using parsing engines, such as tcpdump or wireshark's,
the DNS requests and responses are check for protocol conformity, and
then categorized by DNS content.

The addresses which were advertised as authoratative answers, are
tracked and all flow records received has their addresses checked to see
if they were learned through DNS.

Because flows can live much longer than the DNS references to the addresses
being used, you only really want to check the START records to see if there
is a DNS cache at the time of the start of transaction.

In gargoyle's end system approach for Linux/Mac OS X, we also have argus
events to tell us if there are long lived flows to expect, which we can
use to notify the DNS tracking engine that some of the flows addresses
need not be searched.

Because gargoyles argus may not capture the complete packet payload, the
routines do ensure that they deal with truncation well.  

Radns.1 is an example, and as such, you should be able to add your own
decoders, pretty quickly.  


See the manpage for radns.1 for details.
