Rahosts and its companion rahostsdaily, generate ascii based address
inventories, reporting on the network addresses seen in an argus data
file, and the other addresses that they are talking to.  

In the standard gargoyle suite, this table provides quick lookup
for addresses and gives cursory information on the addresses
community of interest (clique);

Both programs can insert their data into mysql database tables, which
can be used by other programs, especially cgi-scripts to visualize
things like N-degree.

The schema supports IPv4, IPv6 and ethernet address, and provides N-degree
metrics and a list of peer level addresses (L2 and L3 matrix).

Filters can be used to generate "connected" relationships, i.e. process
flow records that are active, to generate empirical interactions, rather
than requests for addresses.
