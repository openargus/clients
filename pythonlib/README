The key to generating a working python library is to provide
acccess to the key python libraries needed, in particular,
the tensorflow_framework.  This may require some hand editing to
get the path correct, at this time if you have a non-standard
python install ...

This library assumes that you have installed:
   python3-devel
   numpy (pip install numpy)
   libcurl-devel


Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code
contributions, etc., should be sent to the Argus mailing list
email address, "argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu".

************************************************************

IMPORTANT:

Send bug (error) reports, questions and comments to the mailing
list at argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu.

Please use the './bin/argusclientbug' script when posting bug reports
about Argus clients. Argusclientbug will gather some information about your
system and start your editor with a form in which you can describe
your problem.  Delete information that you consider non-relevant
to your problem.  Bug reports not generated by Argusbug might
be silently ignored by the Argus maintainers, so please use the
tool.  A report that says 'Argus does not work. Why?' will
not be considered a valid bug report.
