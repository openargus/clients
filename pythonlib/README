The key to generating a working python library is to provide
acccess to the key python libraries needed, in particular,
the tensorflow_framework.  This my require some hand editing to
get the path correct, at this time ...


Problems, bugs, questions, desirable enhancements, source code
contributions, etc., should be sent to the Argus mailing list
email address, "argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu".

IMPORTANT:

Send bug (error) reports, questions and comments to the mailing
list at argus-info@lists.andrew.cmu.edu.

Please use the './bin/argusclientbug' script when posting bug reports
about Argus clients. Argusclientbug will gather some information about your
system and start your editor with a form in which you can describe
your problem.  Delete information that you consider non-relevant
to your problem.  Bug reports not generated by Argusbug might
be silently ignored by the Argus maintainers, so please use the
tool.  A report that says 'Argus does not work. Why?' will
not be considered a valid bug report.
