CHANGES -  This file attempts to capture the changes between argus-clients-3.0.8.4
           and argus-clients-3.0.8.5.  There are some significant changes, so if I
           missed anything, please be kind.


Argus MetaData Support

Argus MetaData Support

In 3.0.8.5 we added JSON format support for the label. In the clients, we have
a configuration variable for the rarc file that can cause any client to convert
the label to JSON.  By default, this is turned off.

All argus clients support the '-M label="regex"' option, which search the contents
of the label string in flow records, and processes those records that match.
Knowing that the format is JSON may impact the format of your regex.

When you aggregate flow records, the labels get merged, and the resulting structures
will be stored either as legacy or JSON.

When you read either formats, the clients will retain the original format for 3.0 Argus.

In Argus 4.0, we intend to shift all metadata to JSON, so this is a transition strategy.
