Notes on building packages for MacOS X

1. The Argus clients should be built with readline support.  Compile
   readline with only static libraries.

   % cd readline-7.0
   % ./configure --prefix=/Users/ekinzie/opt/readline --enable-shared=no
   % make
   % make install

   % cd ../argus-clients
   % ./configure --with-readline=/Users/ekinzie/opt/readline
   % make
   % make osxpackage
