This directory tree contains files used to create standard install materials
for debian-based distributions.

The files in the parent "debian" directory contain instructions for building 
binaries, where production binaries and configuration files will be placed,
and commands to be executed pre- and post-installation, update, removal.

The debian/install file references files in this directory tree 
so that they will be copied into the .deb for installation.

The files in sysconfig are designated as config files so that they won't
be removed during an uninstall or update.

init.d/      - has /etc/init.d daemon scripts for radium and rasplit
               The debian/postinst  file does *not* enable the scripts by default
               To do that use " update-rc.d radium enable "

default/   - has /etc/default  daemon arguments for radium and rasplit
               and commented out examples of using argus, radium and rasplit together
