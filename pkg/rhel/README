Argus Clients 5.0

This directory tree contains files used to create standard install materials
for Redhat-based distributions.

The .spec file is divided into a number of sections describing how to build
binaries, where production binaries and configuration files will be placed,
and commands to be executed pre- and post-installation.

The lib/argus-clients.spec file references files in this directory tree 
so that they will be copied into the RPM for installation.

The files in sysconfig are designated as config files so that they won't
be removed during an uninstall or update.

init.d/      - has /etc/init.d daemon scripts for radium and rasplit
               The .spec file does *not* activate the scripts by default
               To that use "chkconfig"

sysconfig/   - has /etc/sysconfig default daemon arguments for radium and rasplit
                 and commented out examples of using argus, radium and rasplit together
