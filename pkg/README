Argus Clients 3.0
QoSient, LLC
argus@qosient.com
http://qosient.com/argus

This directory tree contains files used to create standard install materials
for various operating system distributions.   The idea is to be able to 
install and configure argus in the ways familiar to system administrators.

Files that reside in this directory are default argus configurations which
are common across all distributions.  Files that differ by distribution
are stored in sub-directories.  For most distributions, the initial bootstrap
for the packaging instructions lies in fixed directories at the root of
the source tarball.  

In order to do packaging, one must install distribution-specific packaging tools
in addition to the normal complement of development tools, e.g. compilers.
The tools can be used to create both source and binary packages.

The rest of this README discusses the individual distributions.  
Look also at the README files in the subdirectories.

########################################################################
   RedHat Enterprise Linux (and derivatives such as Fedora and CentOS )
########################################################################
subdirectory:         rhel/
bootstrap packaging:  lib/argus-clients.spec
default prefix:       /usr

argus has for some time provided the .spec file which can be used
to build RPMs directly from the compressed tarball with:
    rpmbuild -ta argus-clients-n.n.n.tar.gz

Descriptions of RPM packaging for RHEL-based distibutions can be found at:
  http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora_Draft_Documentation/0.1/html/RPM_Guide/index.html

The .spec file is divided into a number of sections describing how to build
binaries, where production binaries and configuration files will be placed,
and commands to be executed pre- and post-installation.

A single .spec file can describe building multiple RPMS

########################################################################
  Debian Linux ( here the Ubuntu variant )
########################################################################

subdirectory:         ubuntu/
bootstrap packaging:  debian/
default prefix:       /usr

Debian-based distribution use a directory of files to specify the
build, install, pre- and post-installation commands. There can
be multiple versions of the files describing multiple packages.

To learn about the packaging files in the 'debian' directory, see:
  http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/debian-dir-overview.html

Note: The debian/control needs work, especially Build-Depends

Note: Pay particular attention the formatting instructions for
      the debian/changelog file.  In particular, the line describing
      the maintainer must *exactly* match your GPG-key when
      signing a package.

Canonical, the overseer of Ubuntu, provides via Launchpad.net a
place where one can practice building and distributing packages
either as group projects or Personal Package Archives (PPA).
For information and instructions, see:
 http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/packaging-new-software.html
