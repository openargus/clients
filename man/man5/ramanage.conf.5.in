.TH RAMANAGE.CONF 5 "13 November 2018" "ramanage.conf 5.0.3"
.SH NAME
\fBramanage.conf\fP \- \fBramanage\fP configuration options
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ramanage.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The following options control the behavior of the compress, upload and
delete commands.
These are set in @sysconfdir@/ramanage.conf or in a file referenced
by the -f option.
On Windows systems, these can be set in the 64-bit registry.
See the WINDOWS REGISTRY section below for details.

.SH RAMANAGE_LOCK_FILE
ramanage is designed to be run from rastream(1).
rastream will spawn one process for each file it closes, as the files
are closed which will lead to multiple ramanage processes.
To prevent all processes from consuming CPU and/or network resources
simultaneously, a lock file can be specified which will ensure that
only one ramanage process is working at any given time.
The filename must be specified using posix conventions, meaning
forward slashes between directories even on Windows systems.
Currently, Cygwin is used for building Windows binaries and therefor
the filenames must also adhere to the layout of Cygwin's "filesystem".
On Unix systems, /var/lib and /var/lock are common places for this
sort of file.

.SH RAMANAGE_COMPRESS_EFFORT
Set the gzip compression effort.
Allowed range is 1-9 inclusive.
Currently not implemented.

.SH RAMANAGE_COMPRESS_METHOD
Set the compression algorithm.
Only gzip is supported.
Currently not implemented.

.SH RAMANAGE_COMPRESS_MAX_KB
Limit the amount of data from the archive that can be compressed in one
run of ramange.
If compression is enabled, ramanage will always compress the file after
the -r option, regardless of size.
After, if archive processing is enabled, ramange will start with the
oldest uncompressed file in the archive and will compress files until
it reaches this limit.
If no limit is specified or is set to zero, ramanage will continue until
the entire archive is compressed.
Must be a positive integer value.

.SH RAMANAGE_UPLOAD_USE_DNS
Look for a service record in DNS pointing to the QoSient collection
system.
The service record (SRV) name has the format
_argus_upload._tcp.\fIdomainname\fP.
ramanage uses the resulting hostname and port values to find the
collector.
Priority and weight are ignored.
Valid values are "yes" and "no".

.SH RAMANAGE_UPLOAD_USE_DNS_DOMAIN
Look in DNS for a service record in this domain.
Use in conjunction with RAMANAGE_UPLOAD_USE_DNS.
Valid values are valid domain names.
Omit the trailing dot/period.

.SH RAMANAGE_UPLOAD_SERVER
If not using a DNS service record to locate the collector,
provide the numeric IPv4 or IPv6 address here.

.SH RAMANAGE_UPLOAD_DIR
Upload (PUT) files into this directory on the collector.
QoSient collectors default to /uploads.
ramanage assumes no default directory.

.SH RAMANAGE_UPLOAD_USER
When using BasicAuth, authenticate with this username.

.SH RAMANAGE_UPLOAD_PASS
When using BasicAuth, authenticate with this password.
Note that if an external curl binary is used, the password
will appear on the commandline.

.SH RAMANAGE_UPLOAD_AUTH
Set the authenticate type for HTTPS uploads.
Leave blank for BasicAuth or set to "spnego"
for Kerberos V5.

.SH RAMANAGE_UPLOAD_MAX_KB
Limit the amount of data from the archive that can be uploaded in one
run of ramange.
If upload is enabled, ramanage will always upload the file after the -r
option, regardless of size.
After, if archive processing is enabled, ramange will start with the
oldest file in the archive and will upload files until it reaches
this limit.
If no limit is specified or is set to zero, ramanage will continue until
the entire archive is uploaded.
Must be a positive integer value.

.SH RAMANAGE_UPLOAD_DELAY_USEC
Delay uploads by some random time limited by this value.
It is assumed that many systems will be uploading data to
the same QoSient collector at the same time (since most systems
have some sort of time synchronization, like NTP).
Stagger the uploads some by waiting for an unpredictable
time.
Disable by setting to zero.

.SH RAMANAGE_PATH_ARCHIVE
Specify the location of the local Argus file archive (mandatory).
The filename must be specified using posix conventions, meaning
forward slashes between directories even on Windows systems.
Currently, Cygwin is used for building Windows binaries and therefor
the filenames must also adhere to the layout of Cygwin's "filesystem".

.SH RAMANAGE_PATH_STAGING
Specify the location of the local Argus file staging directory
(mandatory).
This is where files will be moved after upload.
File remain in this directory until they are deleted,
according to the ramange configuration.
The filename must be specified using posix conventions, meaning
forward slashes between directories even on Windows systems.
Currently, Cygwin is used for building Windows binaries and therefor
the filenames must also adhere to the layout of Cygwin's "filesystem".

.SH RAMANAGE_RPOLICY_DELETE_AFTER
Delete files in the staging and archive directories after the duration
specified here in days.
Must be a positive integer.

.SH RAMANAGE_RPOLICY_COMPRESS_AFTER
Compress files in the staging and archive directories after the
duration specified here in days.
Must be a positive integer.
Set to zero to compress immediately.

.SH RAMANAGE_RPOLICY_MAX_KB
Delete the oldest files in the archive if more than this amount of
storage is used.
Currently not implemented.

.SH RAMANAGE_RPOLICY_MIN_DAYS
Keep at least this many days worth of argus data in the archive, even
if this exceeds the storage requirements set in RAMANAGE_RPOLICY_MAX_KB.
Currently not implemented.

.SH RAMANAGE_RPOLICY_IGNORE_ARCHIVE
Set to "yes" if only the file specified by -r should be processed.
Defaults to "no".

.SH RAMANAGE_PROCESS_ARCHIVE_PERIOD
ramanage is designed to be run from rastream(1).
rastream will spawn one process for each file it closes, as the files
are closed which will lead to multiple ramanage processes.
To prevent the archive compression and upload phases from running in
close succession as a result, specify how often it is permissible
to compress/upload/delete files in the archive.
Value must be a non-negative integer and has units of seconds.

.SH RAMANAGE_CMD_COMPRESS
Set to "yes" to enable file compression.
Defaults to "no".

.SH RAMANAGE_CMD_DELETE
Set to "yes" to enable file deletion.
Defaults to "no".

.SH RAMANAGE_CMD_UPLOAD
Set to "yes" to enable file uploads.
Defaults to "no".

.SH "WINDOWS REGISTRY"
If present, configuration items in the Windows registry will be preferred
over those in configuration files.
These are stored in HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\QoSient\\ArgusClients\\ramanage.
Configuration items have the same names as those in configuration files
and have a type of either SZ for string values, or QWORD for numeric
values.

To view current settings from PowerShell,
.ft CW
.ps 8
.nf
.in +0.5i
C:\\> Get-ItemProperty HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\QoSient\\ArgusClients\\ramanage
.in
.fi
.ps
.ft

Create the registry key if not present:
.ft CW
.ps 8
.nf
.in +0.5i
C:\\> New-Item -Path HKLM:\\SOFTWARE -Name QoSient
C:\\> New-Item -Path HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\QoSient -Name ArgusClients
C:\\> New-Item -Path HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\QoSient\\ArgusClients -Name ramanage
.in
.fi
.ps
.ft

Configuration values can be added to the ramanage key from PowerShell
with the Set-ItemProperty cmdlet.
Numeric values require the -Type parameter.
To enter string values, omit the type parameter.
.ft CW
.ps 8
.nf
.in +0.5i
C:\\> Set-ItemPropery -Path HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\QoSient\\ArgusClients\\ramanage `
.in +0.5i
-Type QWord `
-Name RAMANAGE_RPOLICY_DELETE_AFTER `
-Value 180
.in -0.5i
C:\\> Set-ItemPropery -Path HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\QoSient\\ArgusClients\\ramanage `
.in +0.5i
-Name RAMANAGE_CMD_UPLOAD `
-Value yes
.in -0.5i
.in -0.5i
.fi
.ps
.ft

The regedit program (not regedit32) can be used to create the ramanage
key and its properties if a graphical interface is preferred.
