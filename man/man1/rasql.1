.TH RASQL 1 "12 August 2009" "rasql 3.0.8"
.SH NAME
\fBrasql\fP \- read \fBargus(8)\fP data from mysql database.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rasql
[\fB\-M\fP \fIsql='where clause'\fP] -r mysql://user@host/db/table [\fBraoptions\fP] [\fB--\fP \fIfilter-expression\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  "rasql command"  ""  "\fBrasql\fP \(em argus data"
.LP
\fBRasql\fP reads
.BR argus
data from an argus-client generated mysql database. 

The principal function of rasql is to extract the 'record' binary blob
that is inserted by \fIrasqlinsert.1\fP when adding argus data to a
mysql table.

.SH RASQL SPECIFIC OPTIONS
Rasql, like all ra based clients, supports a number of \fBra options\fP 
including filtering of input argus records through a terminating filter expression. 
\fBrasql(1)\fP specific options are:
.TP 4 4
.BI \-M "\| sql='where clause'\^"
This appends the 'where clause' to the SELECT mysql database command.
providing a means to use SQL select and join strategies when performing queries.


.SH INVOCATION
This invocation reads \fBargus(8)\fP data from the \fItable\fP table that
is contained in the \fIdb\fP database, using the \fIuser\fP database account,
and instructs MySQL to select records where the database attribute 'saddr'
equals to the string '2.3.4.5'.

.nf
 
   \fBrasql\fP -r mysql://user@localhost/db/table -M sql="saddr='2.3.4.5'"
