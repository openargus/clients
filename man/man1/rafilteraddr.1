.TH RAFILTERADDR 1 "12 August 2023" "rafilteraddr 5.0.3"
.SH NAME
\fBrafilteraddr\fP \- select \fBargus(8)\fP data based on an IANA IP address file.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rafilteraddr
\fB[\-f\fP \fIaddress.file\fP [\fB [\-v] [\fBraoptions\fP] [\fB--\fP \fIfilter-expression\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX  "rafilteraddr command"  ""  "\fBrafilteraddr\fP \(em argus data"
.LP
\fBRafilteraddr\fP reads
.BR argus
data from an \fIargus-data\fP source, and selects records that include IP addresses
specified by the \fBaddress.spec\fP file.  This program provides high performance
address matching for any number of addresses.

.SH RAFILTERADDR ADDRESS SPECIFICATION
Rafilteraddr, reads a number of standard IANA IP address file formats that
specify IPv4, CIDR and IPV4 prefix addresses.  Examples of these file types
are provided in ./support/Config.

\fBrafilteraddr(1)\fP specific options are:
.TP 4 4
.B \-f <IPv4 address specification>>
Specify the list of addresses used for the address filter. This file can be in
several IANA based address specification formats, and is the same format as
the address labels for \fBralabel.1\fP.

.TP 4 4
.BI \-v
Invert the logic and print flows that don't match any of the addresses.

.SH INVOCATION
This invocation reads \fBargus(8)\fP data from \fBargusfile\fP and prints
records that match any of the IP addresses in the iana-ipv4-addresses.

   \fBrafilteraddr\fP -r argusfile -f iana-ipv4-addresses -- ip

An example address specification that describes a mix of CIDR addresses,
IPv4 address ranges and explicit addresses:
