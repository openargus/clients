.B Radium
is a real-time Argus Record multiplexor that processes Argus records
and Netflow records and outputs them to any number of client
programs and files.
.B Radium
is a combination of the features of ra.1 and argus.8, supporting access
for upto 128 client programs to argus records originating from remote
data sources and/or local managed argus data files.  Using

.B Ragen
is a real-time Argus Record generator that generates synthetic Argus records
and outputs them to any number of client programs and files.
.B Ragen
is a combination of the features of ra.1, rabins.1 and argus.8, supporting access
for upto 128 client programs to argus records generated from remote
data sources, local managed argus data files and/or database tables.  Like
.B radium
using
.B ragen
>>>>>>> 6d0d6484 (updated for merge problems ....)
you can construct complex distribution networks for collecting and
processing argus data, and providing a single point of access to
archived argus data.
.LP
Designed to run as a daemon,
<<<<<<< HEAD
.B radium
generally reads argus records directly from a remote argus, and writes the
transaction status information to a log file or open socket connected to an
.B argus
client (such as
.BR ra(1) ).
.B Radium
=======
.B ragen
reads data source specifications from ra clients requesting data generation,
and writes the resulting argus data records to a log file or open socket connected to an
.B argus
client (such as
.BR ra(1) ).
.B Ragen
>>>>>>> 6d0d6484 (updated for merge problems ....)
provides the same data access controls as argus.8, including
remote filtering, source address based access control, indivual
oriented strong authentication and confidentiality protection for
the distributed data, using \fBSASL\fP and \fBtcp_wrapper\fP
technology.  Please refer to the INSTALL and README files for
each distribution for a complete description.

is normally configured from a system \fB/etc/radium.conf\fP configuration file,

Radium, like all ra based clients, supports
a number of \fBra options\fP including remote data access, reading
from multiple files and filtering of input argus records through a
terminating filter expression.

.B \-P <portnum>
Specifies the \fB<portnum>\fP for remote client connection.
The default is to not support remote access.
Setting the value to zero (0) will forceably turn off the

<host[:port][//full/path/to/argus.data.file]>
Attach to a specific remote \fIhost\fP to receive argus records. Append
an optional port specifier to attach to a port value other than the default 561.
Without the optional full pathname,

h for seconds, minutes or hours.
.B \-X
<<<<<<< HEAD
Clear existing radium configuration.  This removes any initialization done prior
to encountering this flag.  Allows you to eliminate the effects of the
\fI/etc/radium.conf\fP file, or any radium.conf files that may have been loaded.

.SH SIGNALS
\fBRadium\fP catches a number of \fBsignal(3)\fP events.
The three signals \fBSIGHUP\fP, \fBSIGINT\fP, and \fBSIGTERM\fP
cause \fBradium\fP to exit, writing TIMEDOUT status records for
all currently active transactions.  The signal \fBSIGUSR1\fP
will turn on \fBdebug\fP reporting, and subsequent \fBSIGUSR1\fP
signals, will increment the \fBdebug-level\fP. The signal \fBSIGUSR2\fP
will cause \fBradium\fP to turn off all \fBdebug\fP reporting.
