.LP
.B Radium
is a real-time Argus Record multiplexor that processes Argus records
and Netflow records and outputs them to any number of client
programs and files.
.B Radium
is a combination of the features of ra.1 and argus.8, supporting access
for upto 128 client programs to argus records originating from remote
data sources and/or local managed argus data files.  Using
.B radium
you can construct complex distribution networks for collecting and
processing argus data, and providing a single point of access to
archived argus data.
.LP
Designed to run as a daemon,
.B radium
generally reads argus records directly from a remote argus, and writes the
transaction status information to a log file or open socket connected to an
.B argus
client (such as
.BR ra(1) ).
.B Radium
provides the same data access controls as argus.8, including
remote filtering, source address based access control, indivual
oriented strong authentication and confidentiality protection for
the distributed data, using \fBSASL\fP and \fBtcp_wrapper\fP
technology.  Please refer to the INSTALL and README files for
each distribution for a complete description.
.LP
.B Radium
is normally configured from a system \fB/etc/radium.conf\fP configuration file,
or from a configuration file either in the \fB$RADIUMHOME\fP directory, or specified
on the command line.
.SH RADIUM SPECIFIC OPTIONS
Radium, like all ra based clients, supports
a number of \fBra options\fP including remote data access, reading
from multiple files and filtering of input argus records through a
terminating filter expression.
\fBradium(8)\fP specific options are:
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5 5
.B \-B <addr>
Specify the bind interface address for remote access.  Acceptable values
are IP version 4 addresses.  The default is to bind to INADDR_ANY
address.
.TP 5 5
.BI \-d
Run radium as a daemon.  This will cause radium to do the things that
Unix daemons do and return, if there were no errors, with radium
running as a detached process.
.TP 5 5
.B \-e <value>
Specify the source identifier for this \fBradium\fP.  Acceptable values are
numbers, hostnames or ip address.
.TP 5 5
.B \-f <radium.conf>
Use \fIradium.conf\fP as a source of configuration information.
Options set in this file override any other specification, and so 
this is the last word on option values. This file is read after the
system /etc/radium.conf file is processed. See \fIradium.conf.5\fP for
the configuration file format.
.TP 5 5
.B \-O
Turn off Berkeley Packet Filter optimizer.  No reason to do this unless
you think the optimizer generates bad code.
.TP 5 5
.B \-p
Override the persistent connection facility.
.B Radium
provides a fault tolerant feature for its remote argus data access 
facility.  If the remote argus data source closes, 
.B radium
will maintain its client connections, and attempt to reestablish
its connection with remote source.  This option overrides this behavior,
causing
.B radium
to terminate if any of its remote sources closes.
.TP 5 5
.B \-P <portnum>
Specifies the \fB<portnum>\fP for remote client connection.
The default is to not support remote access.
Setting the value to zero (0) will forceably turn off the
facility.
.TP 5 5
.B \-S
<host[:port][//full/path/to/argus.data.file]>
Attach to a specific remote \fIhost\fP to receive argus records. Append
an optional port specifier to attach to a port value other than the default 561.
Without the optional full pathname, 
.B radium 
will continuously transmit a stream of real-time flow records as they are received.
With the optional filename,
.B radium
will open the argus datafile specified, and stream the contents, closing
the connection with the file EOF.

.TP 5 5
.B \-T threshold[smh] (secs)
Indicate that \fIradium\fP should correct the timestamps of
received \fIargus\fP records, if they are out of sync by threshold
secconds.  Threshold can be specified with the extensions s, m, or
h for seconds, minutes or hours.
.B \-X
Clear existing radium configuration.  This removes any initialization done prior
to encountering this flag.  Allows you to eliminate the effects of the
\fI/etc/radium.conf\fP file, or any radium.conf files that may have been loaded.

.SH SIGNALS
\fBRadium\fP catches a number of \fBsignal(3)\fP events.
The three signals \fBSIGHUP\fP, \fBSIGINT\fP, and \fBSIGTERM\fP
cause \fBradium\fP to exit, writing TIMEDOUT status records for
all currently active transactions.  The signal \fBSIGUSR1\fP
will turn on \fBdebug\fP reporting, and subsequent \fBSIGUSR1\fP
signals, will increment the \fBdebug-level\fP. The signal \fBSIGUSR2\fP
will cause \fBradium\fP to turn off all \fBdebug\fP reporting.

.SH ENVIRONMENT

.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
Run \fBradium\fP as a daemon, reading records from a remote host,
using port 561, and writing all its transaction status reports to
\fIoutput-file\fP.  This is a typical mode.
.RS
.nf
\fBradium -S remotehost:561 -d -e `hostname` -w \fIoutput-file\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
Collect records from multiple argi, using port 561 on one and port
430 on the other, and make all of these records available to other
programs on port 562.
.RS
.nf
\fBradium -S host1:561 -S host2:430 -de `hostname` -P 562
.fi
.RE
.LP
Collect records from multiple Cisco Netflow sources, using
the default port, and make the resulting argus records available
on port 562.
.RS
.nf
\fBradium -C -S host1 -S host2 -de `hostname` -P 562
.fi
.RE
.LP
Radium supports both input filtering and output filtering,
and radium supports multiple output streams, each with their
own independant filters.

If you are interested in distributing IP traffic only (input
filter) and want to separate traffic into differing files
based on traffic type, this simple example separates ICMP
traffic from other traffic.
.RS
.nf
\fBradium -w \fIfile1\fP "icmp" -w \fIfile2\fP "not icmp" - ip
.fi
.RE
.LP
Audit the network activity that is flowing between the two
gateway routers, whose ethernet addresses are 00:08:03:2D:42:01 and
00:00:0C:18:29:F1.  Make records available to other programs through
port 430/tcp.
.RS
.nf
\fBradium -S source -P 430 - ether host (0:8:3:2d:42:1 and 0:0:c:18:29:f1)\fP &
.fi
.RE
.LP
Process argus records from a remote source only between 9am and 5pm every day
and provide access to this stream on port 562.
.RS
.nf
\fBradium -S remotehost -t 9-17 -P 562
